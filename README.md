# Hello, nice to meet you ðŸ¤™

<div align="justify">

My passion for technology began in childhood when I used to download PokÃ©mon ROMs to play. Occasionally, I would accidentally download malicious files that crashed my computer, but this only fueled my curiosity to understand how everything worked. This fascination grew into a desire to develop technological solutions that positively impact peopleâ€™s lives.

Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Information Systems at the Federal Institute of Education, Science, and Technology Baiano (IFBAIANO), with a particular interest in data science focused on environmental issues. I am also an enthusiast of using technological tools and programming as educational support to enhance young peopleâ€™s cognitive development, as well as green IT and the field of HCI (Human-Computer Interaction), with a special focus on applications for people with limited educational backgrounds.
